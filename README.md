The project encompasses three key areas: drawing up an EERD diagram, constructing the foundation of a database utilizing MSSQL, and creating a website using ASP.net and C# to make the system accessible and user-friendly.The system users are split into five groups: System Admin, Sports Association Manager, Club Representative, Stadium Manager and Fan. Other entities include Club, Stadium, Match, Ticket, and Host Request. Matches are played by two teams, one of which acts as the host, and each club has a representative who is in charge of requesting permission to host matches when the club acts as the host. The Stadium Manager is responsible for approving or rejecting requests from clubs to host matches at their stadium. The System Admin has the ability to add or delete clubs, stadiums and temporarily block fans from using the system. The Sports Association Manager can create, edit or delete matches and once a match is approved by the stadium manager, the tickets for the match will be available for the fans to buy and the system will keep track of the tickets purchase by the fans.
